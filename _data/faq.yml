- question: What is Navio?
  answer: >
    Navio is the world's only fully private blockchain powered by our unique Proof-of-Private-Stake (PoPS) consensus mechanism.
    <br><br>Designed as a decentralized privacy platform, Navio makes private blockchain applications easily accessible to anyone. Running on the cutting-edge blsCT protocol and PoPS consensus, every transaction on this chain remains private by default.
    <br><br>We facilitate anonymous payments, enable decentralized banking and provide a truly untraceable blockchain experience.

- question: Why is Navio called "Navio"?
  answer: >
    The name Navio comes from NAV + IO. NAV stands for Network of Anonymous Validators,
    reflecting a consensus layer where validator identities and stake amounts remain
    private. IO refers to Inputs and Outputs, the fundamental structure of transactions.
    <br><br>
    Together, Navio represents private validators securing private inputs and outputs.
    Privacy is enforced at both the consensus and transaction layers, not added as an
    afterthought.

- question: How can I get Navio?
  answer: >
    You can acquire NAV by purchasing it on supported centralized exchanges,
    swapping for it on decentralized exchanges, or receiving it directly from
    another Navio holder via a peer-to-peer transfer. After acquiring NAV, you
    should move it to a Navio-compatible wallet to hold it privately, stake it,
    and participate in the network and its privacy-first ecosystem.
    <br><br>
    A list of supported exchanges is available on the official Navio website.

- question: How is Navio different from Bitcoin?
  answer: >
    Bitcoin secures trust by putting everything in the open. Transactions, balances,
    and miner activity are permanently visible, and security is enforced through
    energy-intensive mining.
    <br><br>
    Navio secures trust by hiding what does not need to be seen. It uses privacy-by-default
    transactions and private staking to verify the system without exposing users,
    validators, or stake distribution.
    <br><br>
    Bitcoin proves honesty through exposure; Navio proves it through cryptography.

- question: What is PoPS (Proof-of-Private-Stake)?
  answer: >
    PoPS (Proof-of-Private-Stake) is Navio’s consensus mechanism. It secures the network
    through staking without revealing validator identities or stake amounts.
    <br><br>
    In traditional Proof of Stake systems, staking information is public, which leaks
    data about who controls the network. PoPS removes this exposure, allowing the
    network to remain secure while achieving full anonymity at the consensus layer,
    something traditional PoS systems cannot provide.

- question: Are there videos available to learn about Navio?
  answer: >
    Yes. Navio provides video tutorials and educational content covering the protocol,
    wallets, staking, and privacy concepts. Links to official video resources can be
    found on the Navio website and community channels.

- question: Does Navio have a block size limit?
  answer: >
    Yes. Navio has a maximum block size of 4 MB. This provides enough room for
    privacy-heavy transactions without allowing blocks to grow so large that only
    powerful machines can keep up.
    <br><br>
    The limit preserves strong default privacy while keeping the network fast,
    decentralized, and practical to run.

- question: How does Navio provide privacy shielding for tokens from other blockchains?
  answer: >
    Navio enables privacy shielding by allowing external assets to be represented
    within Navio’s privacy-preserving transaction system. Once shielded, these assets
    benefit from Navio’s default privacy guarantees, including hidden senders,
    receivers, and amounts.
    <br><br>
    This allows users to interact with assets from other blockchains without exposing
    transaction metadata on public ledgers, while still maintaining cryptographic
    correctness and verifiability.

- question: How can I contribute to Navio?
  answer: >
    Navio is an open-source, privacy-first project, and contributions are welcome
    from both technical and non-technical participants.

    <br><br><strong>1) Contributing to the codebase</strong><br>
    Developers can help by auditing cryptography, improving performance, fixing bugs,
    or building wallets, tooling, and integrations. This is high-impact work, as
    privacy systems benefit enormously from peer review and real-world testing.

    <br><br><strong>2) Privacy research and cryptographic review</strong><br>
    Researchers can contribute by reviewing assumptions, stress-testing threat models,
    proposing protocol improvements, and identifying edge-case privacy leaks. In
    privacy systems, critique is a contribution, not an attack.

    <br><br><strong>3) Ecosystem and community building</strong><br>
    Non-technical contributions matter deeply. Documentation, tutorials, education,
    translations, and community moderation all help ensure privacy technology is used
    correctly. Privacy fails if users do not understand the tools they are given.

- question: How is Navio's privacy different from other coins?
  answer: >
    Navio uses blsCT (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham Confidential Transactions) with Pedersen commitments to hide amounts, 
    conceal sender and receiver links, and extend privacy into staking through Proof-of-Private-Stake, 
    aiming for protocol-wide privacy by default.
    <br>
    Monero uses ring signatures to obscure the sender, stealth addresses for the receiver, and RingCT 
    with Pedersen commitments to hide amounts, delivering strong default transaction privacy but limited 
    to payments within its Proof-of-Work model.
    <br>
    Zcash relies on zk-SNARK zero-knowledge proofs to fully shield transactions when users opt into 
    shielded addresses, offering powerful privacy but in an optional and mixed transparent system.
    <br>
    In short: Monero perfects transaction-level anonymity, Zcash offers optional zero-knowledge shielding, 
    while Navio combines confidential transactions with BLS aggregation and private staking to push privacy deeper into the consensus layer itself.


- question: If Navio is so private how do we know they're not being created out of thin air?
  answer: >
    Navio hides transaction amounts using Pedersen commitments, but each transaction still includes mathematical proofs 
    that the total inputs equal the total outputs. Validators can verify the arithmetic without seeing the actual numbers, 
    so no extra coins can be created secretly. If someone tries to create coins “out of thin air,” the cryptographic proof fails 
    and the network rejects the transaction. 
    <br>
    Privacy hides the data, not the rules of supply.


- question: Why is Proof-of-Private-Stake (PoPS) more secure than Proof-of-Work (PoW)?
  answer: >
    Proof-of-Private-Stake (PoPS) is generally more secure than Proof-of-Work (PoW) because attacking it requires owning and risking 
    a large portion of the actual coin supply, not just renting computational power.
    <br>
    In PoW systems like Monero, an attacker can potentially rent or accumulate enough hash power to attempt a 51 percent attack 
    without owning much of the coin itself. In PoPS, an attacker must acquire a significant share of the total stake, which is 
    typically far more expensive and directly exposes their funds to penalties or loss if they act maliciously.
    <br>
    Additionally:<br>
    • No ASIC or mining hardware centralization risk<br>
    • No reliance on electricity dominance<br>
    • Validators have capital locked and at risk<br>
    • Private staking reduces visibility of validator balances, lowering targeted attack vectors<br>
    <br>
    In short, PoPS ties network security to economic ownership and direct financial risk, making attacks 
    structurally more costly and self damaging than hash-based attacks in PoW.
